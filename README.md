# Coffee_machine
This repository contains a Python program that simulates a simple coffee machine. The program allows users to select from various drinks (espresso, latte, cappuccino), processes payments, checks resource levels, and handles transactions efficiently. Maintainers can turn off the machine and generate reports on the current resource status.
